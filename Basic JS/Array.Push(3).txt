Basic JavaScript: Manipulate Arrays With push()
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.

.push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.

Examples:

var arr1 = [1,2,3];
arr1.push(4);
// arr1 is now [1,2,3,4]

var arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
// arr2 now equals ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]]

We have defined a function, mixedNumbers, which we are passing an array as an argument.
 Modify the function by using push() and unshift() to add 'I', 2, 'three' to the beginning of the array and 7, 'VIII', 9 to the end
 so that the returned array contains representations of the numbers 1-9 in order.

function mixedNumbers(arr) {
  arr.unshift("I",2,"three")
  arr.push(7, "VIII", 9)
  return arr;
}

console.log(mixedNumbers(['IV', 5, 'six']));
OUYPUT: [ 'I', 2, 'three', 'IV', 5, 'six', 7, 'VIII', 9 ]
