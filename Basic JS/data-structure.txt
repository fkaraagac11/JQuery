We've defined a function, checkInventory, which receives a scanned item as an argument. 
Return the current value of the scannedItem key in the foods object. 
You can assume that only valid keys will be provided as an argument to checkInventory.

let foods = {
  apples: 25,
  oranges: 32,
  plums: 28,
  bananas: 13,
  grapes: 35,
  strawberries: 27
};

function checkInventory(scannedItem) {
  // Only change code below this line

return foods[scannedItem]
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(checkInventory("apples"));

Use the delete keyword to remove the oranges, plums, and strawberries keys from the foods object.

let foods = {
  apples: 25,
  oranges: 32,
  plums: 28,
  bananas: 13,
  grapes: 35,
  strawberries: 27
};

// Only change code below this line
delete foods.oranges;
delete foods.plums;
delete foods.strawberries;
// Only change code above this line

console.log(foods);
